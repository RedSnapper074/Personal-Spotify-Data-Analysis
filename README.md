# Personal-Spotify-Data-Analysis
This Spotify Analysis was performed using Microsoft Power BI
This project demonstrates a diverse range of visualizations created using Microsoft Power BI, focusing on my personal Spotify Dataset. Retrieving
our personalized Spotify data typically involves a waiting period of approximately 30 days, culminating in the acquisition of a JSON file. This data was
subsequently imported into Power BI, and the process of Data Cleaning was employed to ensure the dataset's readiness for analysis.
Several noteworthy visualizations were produced, including:
1) Artist and Album Playback Duration: Calculating the total minutes dedicated to playing each Artist and Album, shedding light on personal musical
preferences.
2) Top and Bottom 10 Artists/Albums: Identifying the most and least favored Artists and Albums through a comprehensive analysis of playback
statistics.
3) Song Skip Analysis: Investigating the primary reasons behind song skipping, contributing to a deeper understanding of user engagement.
4) Prevalent Music Genre: Determining the most favored music genre, a key insight into individual musical inclinations.
5) Albums and Artists Treemap: Crafting an informative Treemap visualization to highlight the distribution of Albums and Artists based on relevant
parameters.
This project not only showcases proficiency in utilizing Microsoft Power BI for generating meaningful insights from personal Spotify data but also
underscores the critical role of meticulous Data Cleaning in achieving accurate and actionable results.
